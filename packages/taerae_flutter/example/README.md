# taerae_flutter_example

This example shows how to:

- create and mutate an embedded graph with `TaeraeGraphController`.
- render current nodes/edges in Flutter UI.
- run BFS shortest-path queries locally (`alice -> seoul`).
- call `TaeraeFlutter.getPlatformVersion()` as a platform-channel smoke check.
